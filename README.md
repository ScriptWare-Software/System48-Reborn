# System48

This is one of my most well renowned products, it existed between 2016 and 2018 - with about four iterations, each better than the last, this is the product that helped me shape myself and start learning about exactly what I am doing. Thanks to two special people in my journey of developing exploits. This is the last iteration of this series of versions, and this version was then given to RTF to continue. With a coincidence, I bumped into RTF and he still happened to have this source code! Meaning I can finally share it to the public.

## A little back story
I started this product in 2016 with an old friend, and co-founder of an old clan I had called AzuL (but thats for another story) named Script. This person helped me create the first version of this software which was my first time using LuaC as well as my first time playing around with Roblox's retcheck. After successfully playing around and Script giving me various demonstration functions, I managed to create a few functions and decided to make it a full time project. The interface was that of a Windows console, and this wasn't because that is how they were back then - it was just because I wanted it to have a nostalgic feel. [Here is a demo video of the first version.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdITxdAhIio) The text writing effect was given to me by 3dsboy08 as he created it for his product at the time.

Later after this I decided to abandon the concept after Script showed me what he had worked on (a project featuring a cooler interface as well as something else which I will talk about soon). I moved to that and he helped me set it up and work with it. He also showed me a concept he had come up with - the ability to simply allow users to just run LuaC functions through the application, they can sort of create their own functions? At first I was under the impression that most users would literally have no idea as to what it means or what to do and to give everyone a chance I made a small guide on the left on how to kill a player via BreakJoints. Needless to say, this sort of kicked off and users really enjoyed it, I gave demos of the things you could do and these were dubbed "LuaC Scripts" and the term kicked off, later on people started to create their own cool "LuaC Scripts" and share them around. Other products later replicated this concept (I am aware I wasn't the first, I just believe my product popularised it).

After, I had met a person called Quad Core. Quad Core had the impression that I was a script kiddie (of which, lets face it, wasn't exactly far from the truth) and had a negative opinion of me. Regardless, we spoke to each other and I showed him all the work I had done and everything I had come up with, he grew fond of the idea and eventually became good friends with me - he ended up showing me his recreation of an extremely old and very well loved product called [SilentCowz Pro X (SPV-X)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUr3BoANpIs). Being somebody who really loved the product and especially the interface - I really wanted it. I bought it off him for something like 70 bucks or so and decided to use it for System48. Here came System48 V3.

V3 was the big number for System48 - it was what grew my product. After experimenting around with the interface and trying to merge my code base into it to get it all working just like the original - I invited Quad Core to straight up just join development with me, he agreed to do so. Quad Core was an extremely smart, bright and ambitious person, at the time I was far from something like that - having someone of whom was so skilled as a good friend and now co-owner of my product was extremely thrilling and exciting. I was finally able to have someone to teach me properly, he showed me all of the cool things he knew how to do (we together worked on a retcheck bypass) and it grew Dystem48 from a small and pretty basic product (apart from some cool features) into a very exciting and actually really well made products.

It came with things such like:
* Unreal stability, really stable and well maintained
* A proper chathook, users could basically run System48 in-game chat as if they were admin in a game. ";ff me" for example.
* Name shortcuts, instead of writing the entire users name - you can write a shortened version and we would find the users full name for you and automatically perform the function.
* In addition to that, alias such as "me", "others", "random", "all", "guests", etc., were introduced - making life extremely easy for the user.

To understand what this means, at the time users of typical products had to write out the entire username of the user of whom they wanted to run a command on. Say the name was PrincessUnicornEpixXXx, instead of running "kill princess" and having the code find the user, they would have to write "kill PrincessUnicornEpixXXx" - a slight misspell and it wouldn't work. A bunch of this was Quad Core's doing, he sternly showed me around everything and educated me on things properly. Having someone I could easily ask queastions to and get a solid response out of whenever I was confused or needed help was really comforting. The big issue with our community is that people shame others extremely fast - I didn't have this with Quad Core. Albeit System48 wasn't the first for this, it made it extremely common because...

The source was leaked! Eventually a user managed to get their hands onto the V3 source and leak it out on v3rmillion.net - therefore, many users took pieces of the code and added it to their products - such as the chathook. This is then why I decided to make this final version of the product. I had hundreds of customers who were still interested in a cool product that worked well. I made this "Reborn" version to give them something to made, shortly after completing it - I managaed to get my hands on Roblox's Serialiser and ended up developing my first script executor which you can see [here](https://github.com/azulx/ROBLOX_EX-7). I had to devote my time to the other project as that one was more important to me, so I ended up giving this product to RTF, an old friend of mine and someone who I saw a lot of opportunity in.

He maintained the source code and updated it routinely for Roblox - leaving my old customers with a working product and leaving me with the time to devote to EX-7.

*(I really looked up to Austin, creator of Elysian. This source code heavily reflects my influence of him, with a similar writing style to his leaked work. I also used his print function)*

## What does this source code feature?

Well, everything! This was the pinnacle of everything I had at the time and I made it into a cute smaller interface instead of the old UI in an attempt to modernise it as exploits were starting to progress past big buttons and consoles into fully fledged, animated interface that are the normal nowadays. With 100+ functions, an original chathook, as well as featuring the Lua C commands for people to utilise it was without a doubt the **best** command based product of the time. Nothing came close to it in terms of capability back them for command based software.

## Can I use this code?

Yes, but you shouldn't even bother. This dates from 2017 (I think?), it is severly outdated and not even worth updating or working with - it is just a relic I wanted to share for a good while. Thanks to RTF for sharing it back to me after I had lost it for many years. People have a tendency to attempt to update my old work (Script-Ware V1 being a major victim of this, it was updated all the way to 2020!), I would just tell you to not even really bother.

## Ending

Thank you to Quad Core for giving me this opportunity to be educated and finally use my brain for good. He is a main reason I am who I am today and someone who was always there for my questions and mental health. I wish him best of luck in whatever he is doing today.

Thank you to RTF for taking up the chance to continue the software as well as giving me the source code back after 3 or so years.
